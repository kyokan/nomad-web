Nomad is a peer-to-peer, ownerless social network. 

Using a peer-to-peer storage protocol called DDRP, Nomad allows you to write and share posts on your feed by gossiping among your peers. By design of the DDRP network, anyone can observe or contribute to this global social database, creating a truly open and free social network without a master.

The name, Nomad, is inspired by the phenomenon of animal migration. 

"Animal migration is a wondrous thing. Driven by seasonal changes in daylight and other factors, an incredible array of organisms fly, creep or run through urban and other habitat-restricted areas on their way to or from richer spots for wintering, feeding or breeding. When you watch the movement of migrants (and I know birds best), you see the beauty of the individuals, and are privy to the performance of ancient commands dictated by genetic coding. It is often a species' most vulnerable moment. Human-driven and other shifts can occur too quickly for an individual to adjust: a bird that has flown all night looks down at the landscape that emerges at dawn, and seeks an accommodating wood that may or may not still be standing." - Joel Greenberg (https://www.nature.com/articles/508317a)

Since the age of information, we have migrated and explored many different social platforms on the internet, searching for a "home" where we can express ourselve freely and safely. Ironically, as more people embrace and adopt these social network, the masters of these networks are forced to adopt an increasingly stricter sets of rules, taking away the freedom of expression that initially drawn us to the platform.

The motivation behind Nomad is that such a "home" for billions of people should not have a master. People should be able to decide on their own what to observe and create on the network without having to subscribe to one globally-enforced set of rules. No one should experience finding themselves without a "home" because their opinions are not represented in the group of masters.
